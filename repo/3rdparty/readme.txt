This directory, `3rdparty', will include 3rd party libraries/tools.

HOW TO MAINTAIN:

  1. New library goes to its own directory under 3rdparty.
     Example, for 'shunit2-2.1.6' goes to 'shunit2'

  2. Specific version goes to version number directory.
     Using similar 'shunit2-2.1.6' example, you'll create a '2.1.6'
     directory within 'shunit2'

  3. A symbolic link 'current' points to latest revision of of the tool
